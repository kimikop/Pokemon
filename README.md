# Pokemon
This accesses a Pokemon API allowing you to look up a certain Pokemon's ability!
You search by running the program and typing in either 'next' or 'back' to view the list of Pokemon in increments of 10.
When you see a Pokemon you want to know more about you type in its name and the Pokemon's abilities will be displayed!
